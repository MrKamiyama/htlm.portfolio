<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jose Rodriguez, I am currently 31 years of age and this would 
  be my second time attempting coding, it has been a hard journey while maintaining a 
  full time 9 to 5 and having a 4 year old precious little boy to take care of as a single parent
  it has been mostly challenging for me to find motivation in those days that just get too hard for myself to 
  get up and just start coding. But this is it, this is the time!
</p>

<p>I have always had a passion for computers since I was about 11 years old, and although most of my time has been spent in gaming 
  when I was in highschool I did my end of year project in my career path of becoming a game creator 
  and coding has always been an interest of mine.
</p>

<p>As most of us know computers are a fairly recent concept to become accepted my family has never been accepting 
  of the idea of spending more than maybe a few hours infront of a monitor, and the benefits that can be obtained
  from coding and not just that but the posibilities or worlds that can exist in a simple file. Something so small can really 
  contain something as big as the world as we know it.
